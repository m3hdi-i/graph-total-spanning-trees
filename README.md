# Total number of Spanning Trees in a Graph
This is a python script just written for my "Graph Theory and Applications" course that calculates the total number of spanning trees of a graph using [Kirchhoff’s Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_theorem).

 Usage:
to running this, you need to have “NumPy” python package, that can be installed by :

    pip install numpy

After that, just simply execute the `main.py` and program asks you for nodes count and adjacency matrix of your graph to calculate the result.
